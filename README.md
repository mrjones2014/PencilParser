# RIP-Harambe
Hackital hackathon project

Have you ever woken up and really wanted to be Harambe? What about Rick Ross? Or maybe you just want to laugh and Donald Trump's ridiculous toupee? If you're like me, it's a weekly occurence.

Well now, **your dreams can come true!!**

RIP-Harambe uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision library) with Python 2.7 bindngs to make your dream come true.

Best of all, RIP-Harambe uses machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize human faces, and features HARAMBE! Do I even need to say anything else???
